===========
Hello Micro Arcade Teams. To get started on the project, please review the first Arduino tutorial on the course website. The slides can be found under the Resources->Tutorial Slides section. Video of the tutorial is also available under the Lecture Recording section for the first tutorial, and Tutorial recordings for the second tutorial.

Submissions will occur via your team GitHub repository. You will create a sketch file starting from the distribution code. Your entire implementation will be in this one file. We will retrieve your file from your group repository on the due date.
